Thesis-Application
==================
This project includes a part of the the application developed for my M.Eng thesis. 
Detailed description here: http://web.mit.edu/aeroastro/labs/halab/papers/Thesis-Radhika.pdf

The overall goal for this project was to develop an application for Boeing to use in their assembly line to track tasks 
accomplished during a shift in their manufacturing operations and re-plan tasks when worker availabilities change during
a shift.

There are 2 main components in this project--
- A scheduler that solves a constraint satisfaction problem using backtracking search (contained in the package Thesis-Application/src/hal/taskscheduler/model/)
- An interface prototype for an Android 10" tablet.
